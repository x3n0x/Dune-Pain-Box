# Dune-Pain-Box
Pain Box Project for Hackaday.IO

Please see and read the instructions on hackaday.io to build this device.

Also, note that you build this thing at your own risk!  I am not responsible 
if you fry your pacemaker or any other such nonsense by building and actually using this thing...

I would however like to know if you did, and if you had any thoughts or ideas for 
improvement or just want to drop me a line.  Contact me via hackaday.io if you would like
to talk!  Also, give skulls...  More skulls!

Enjoy!  Dont hurt yourself!
